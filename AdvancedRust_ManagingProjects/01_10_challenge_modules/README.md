In this video the instructor introduce a challenge.
The code comes with the `main.rs` already we just have to organize it.

## Goals
- Move code below the main function into a new module named `shapes`. 
- Make modifications to the code in the main source file to reference and use the new `shapes` module. 
- Limit the use of the `pub` keyword to only expose members of these shapes module that need to be public for this program to work.
