# 02.09

In this video the instructor introduce a challenge.
The code to start with should be the one from class `01.10`

## Goals
- Implement unit test within the `shapes` library
	- Exercise all `Rectangle` and `Circle` functions
- Implement integreation test using the `shapes` and `rand` crates
	- Use `rand` to generate width/height/radius values for test cases.

> [!Note]
> since the code from 01.10 only have a binary crate you will need to create a 
> `lib` crate in order to implement an integration test.
